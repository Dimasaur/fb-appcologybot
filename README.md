# Guide for creating your own Facebook Messenger bot!

In this guide, you will learn how to setup a fully functional Facebook Messenger Chatbot that can be tested in real-time locally. The bot in this guide is coded using Node.js.

All the files you will need are available above: [index.js](../master/index.js), [package.json](../master/package.json), and [.gitignore](../master/.gitignore)

These files are intended to be used as a framework for your own project by simplifying coding for the bot to if...else statements that are easily modified. More specific instructions are in the files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
