# Create your own Facebook Messenger bot!

In this guide, you will learn how to setup a fully functional Facebook Messenger Chatbot that can be tested in real-time locally. The bot in this guide is coded using JavaScript.

All the files you will need are available above: [index.js](../master/index.js), [package.json](../master/package.json), and [.gitignore](../master/.gitignore)

These files are intended to be used as a framework for your own project by simplifying coding for the bot to if...else statements that are easily modified. More specific instructions are in the files.

For the full setup instructions see the Google Doc linked on our Canvas page.
